## How to use this guide
This guide is mainly targetted towards users who are looking to publicise an event or activity through the use of posters. If you belong to a student organisation, Fifth Row or any other relevant parties, this is the guide for you!

## Steps
1. Get poster approved by your own organisation.
2. Drop ROOT Communications an email (communications@studentgov.sutd.edu.sg) with the attached poster in pictoral format (.jpeg, .png etc). Ensure the following:
   - Poster is A4 size.
   - Poster has space for the ROOT approval stamp.
   - Poster has the contact person's name and phone number.
   - Email has the contact person's name and phone number.
   - Email has the start and end date for the duration that the poster will be up.
3. Message on the SUTD Publicity Chat (https://t.me/SUTDPUBLICITY) that a poster has been sent in for approval. (Eg 'Hi, [organisation] has just sent in a poster for approval!')
4. Wait for ROOT Communications reply to your email. The email should contain your poster with the ROOT approval stamp and take-down date.
5. Send the poster *with the ROOT approval stamp* for printing.
6. Put up the posters in approved locations around campus.
